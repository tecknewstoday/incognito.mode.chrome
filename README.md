Chrome’s Incognito mode prevents websites from tracking you when you’re online. Because Chrome can’t guarantee that extensions aren’t tracking you, they are disabled in Incognito mode by default.

## How to Open Incognito Mode in Chrome ?

Data files are used by your computer for a variety of purposes, ranging from keeping a history of the sites you visited to saving site-specific preferences in small text files known as cookies. Chrome Incognito Mode removes most private data components so they are not left behind at the end of the current session.

Select the Chrome main menu button, represented by three vertically placed dots and located in the upper-right corner of the browser window. When the drop-down menu appears, choose New Incognito Window.

To launch incognito mode using a keyboard shortcut, press Ctrl+Shift+N on Chrome OS, Linux, and Windows, or press Cmd+Shift+N on Mac OS X or macOS. You can also open a new incognito window with the File menu on a Macintosh.

## What Incognito Browsing Means

When you browse privately, no one else who uses your computer can see your activity. Bookmarks and downloads are saved, however.

While you are in Incognito Mode, Chrome does not save:

* Information entered in forms
* Browsing history
* Cookies and site data
